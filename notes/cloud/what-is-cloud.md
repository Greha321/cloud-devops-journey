&nbsp;**What is Cloud Computing?**



&nbsp;Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics over the internet (“the cloud”) on a pay-as-you-go basis.



Instead of buying and maintaining physical hardware, users can rent resources from cloud providers (like AWS) and use them whenever needed.



In simple words:



Cloud computing means using someone else’s powerful computers over the internet and paying only for what you use.



🌟 **Advantages and Benefits of Cloud Computing**

1️⃣ Trade Capital Expenses for Variable Expenses

Meaning:



You don’t need to spend a large amount of money upfront on servers, data centers, or hardware.



You pay only for the resources you actually use.



Example:



Traditional: Buy servers worth ₹10 lakhs even if usage is low.



Cloud: Pay only for EC2 hours used.



Benefit:



✔ Lower upfront cost

✔ Better financial planning



2️⃣ Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale

Meaning:



Cloud providers buy hardware in huge quantities, reducing the cost per unit.



These savings are passed on to customers.



Example:



AWS runs millions of servers worldwide.



Cost per server is much cheaper than what an individual company can achieve.



Benefit:



✔ Lower cost

✔ High performance at low price



3️⃣ Stop Guessing Capacity

Meaning:



You don’t need to predict how much infrastructure you’ll need in the future.



You can increase or decrease resources anytime.



Example:



Website traffic increases suddenly → scale servers instantly.



Traffic decreases → reduce servers.



Benefit:



✔ No over-provisioning

✔ No under-provisioning



4️⃣ Increase Speed and Agility

Meaning:



Resources can be provisioned in minutes instead of weeks.



Faster experimentation and innovation.



Example:



Launch a new EC2 instance in minutes.



Quickly test new applications.



Benefit:



✔ Faster development

✔ Quicker response to business needs



5️⃣ Stop Spending Money on Running and Maintaining Data Centers

Meaning:



Cloud providers handle:



Hardware



Power



Cooling



Physical security



Maintenance



Example:



No need to hire staff for server maintenance.



No need to worry about hardware failures.



Benefit:



✔ Reduced operational overhead

✔ Focus on core business



6️⃣ Go Global in Minutes

Meaning:



Cloud providers have data centers all over the world.



You can deploy applications in multiple regions easily.



Example:



Launch servers in India, USA, Europe within minutes.



Serve users with low latency globally.



Benefit:



✔ Global reach

✔ Better user experience

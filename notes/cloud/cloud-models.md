☁️ Types of Cloud Computing (Service Models)

Cloud computing is classified into three main service models based on how much control the user has and what the cloud provider manages.

1️⃣ IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service
Definition:

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources such as servers, storage, and networking over the internet.

What the Cloud Provider Manages:

Physical servers

Storage

Networking

Data center infrastructure

What the User Manages:

Operating system

Applications

Runtime

Data

Examples:

AWS EC2

Google Compute Engine

Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines

Use Case:

When you want full control over the server.

Hosting websites, applications, databases.

Advantages:

✔ High flexibility
✔ Full control over infrastructure

2️⃣ PaaS – Platform as a Service
Definition:

PaaS provides a platform to develop, test, and deploy applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure.

What the Cloud Provider Manages:

Servers

Storage

Networking

Operating system

Runtime

What the User Manages:

Application code

Data

Examples:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Google App Engine

Heroku

Use Case:

Developers focusing only on coding, not server management.

Advantages:

✔ Faster development
✔ No server maintenance

3️⃣ SaaS – Software as a Service
Definition:

SaaS delivers ready-to-use software applications over the internet.

What the Cloud Provider Manages:

Everything (infrastructure, platform, application)

What the User Manages:

Only usage and configuration

Examples:

Gmail

Google Drive

Dropbox

Microsoft Office 365

Use Case:

End users using software via browser.

Advantages:

✔ No installation
✔ Accessible from anywhere

☁️ Cloud Computing Deployment Models

Deployment models define where the cloud infrastructure is located and who can access it.

1️⃣ Public Cloud
Definition:

Cloud resources are owned and managed by a third-party provider and shared among multiple users.

Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform

Characteristics: Accessible over the internet, Pay-as-you-go, Highly scalable

Advantages: Low cost, Easy to use, High scalability

Disadvantages: Less control, Shared infrastructure

2️⃣ Private Cloud
Definition:

Cloud infrastructure is used by a single organization only.

Examples: Company’s own data center, VMware private cloud

Characteristics: More secure, Customizable

Advantages: High security, Full control

Disadvantages: High cost, Maintenance required

3️⃣ Hybrid Cloud
Definition:

Hybrid cloud is a combination of public cloud and private cloud.

Examples: Sensitive data on private cloud, Public applications on AWS

Characteristics: Flexible deployment, Data portability

Advantages: Best of both worlds, High flexibility

Disadvantages: Complex management

4️⃣ Community Cloud (Less Common)
Definition:

Cloud infrastructure is shared by multiple organizations with similar requirements.

Examples: Government departments, Research institutions

Advantages: Shared cost, Common compliance

Disadvantages: Limited scalability
